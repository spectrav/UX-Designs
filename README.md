# UX-Designs
UX Designs created in my spare time, as my proffesional work is labeled as "Proprietary".

This branch specifically deals with "Walking Dead Road To Survival" All wireframes, workflows and requirements
created for my suggestions or in support of popular opinions from other players.

Designs are created in Paint to save time and are not considered UI "Mock-Ups" they are Wire Frames 
and are reflected as such in quality.

Workflows are created in Visio, each include a User, System, and External Swimlane.
Labeled with an identifier so they can later be linked to corresponding requirements.

Requirements are not created as of now, they are bland and reside in excel spread sheets.
